# Film Data Analysis Project

This project started as exploratory data analysis for film data I found on kaggle. It resulted in a multiple regression model (pictured below) used to predict worldwide gross revenue for films based on production budget, movie rating, and genre.

Please refer to AnalysisWalkthrough.md to see my process in making this model.

This project is merely meant to show the capabilities of python and it's libraries. The dataset used is incomplete, and the predictions from the model do not indicate any real world events.
